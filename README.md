# Hi, I’m Lokendra Solanki 👋

** Petroleum Engineer | Software Developer | Backend + AI Engineering | Real-Time Systems | Oil & Gas Tech**  
📍 Houston, Texas

I build **production-grade backend systems** and **AI-powered pipelines** that work reliably in the real world — especially where **real-time data**, **automation**, and **scalability** matter.

I currently work at **Corva**, where I design and deliver systems used in live drilling operations. I enjoy taking ownership of ambiguous problems, shipping end-to-end solutions, and building software that reduces manual work at scale.

## 🚀 What I’m working on
- **Real-time streaming systems** (Kafka, event-driven pipelines)
- **Production ML workflows** (training → inference → monitoring → serving)
- **LLM engineering**: prompt engineering, RAG, agentic workflows
- Building scalable **APIs** and internal tools (FastAPI, Postgres)
- Reliability-first engineering (idempotency, retries, observability)

## 🧩 Featured Project: Real-Time Anomaly Detection Platform
A full end-to-end AI engineering project that simulates streaming sensor data, performs online anomaly detection, persists results, sends alerts, and exposes an API + dashboard.

✅ Kafka producer/consumer streaming ingestion  
✅ Online inference using **Isolation Forest (scikit-learn)**  
✅ **MLflow Tracking + Model Registry** (Production model serving)  
✅ PostgreSQL persistence + indexes + idempotent writes  
✅ FastAPI backend (auth + pagination + connection pooling)  
✅ Slack alerts + alert throttling  
✅ Streamlit dashboard consuming the API  
✅ Fully containerized with Docker + Docker Compose  

**Tech:** Python, Kafka, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, MLflow, scikit-learn, Docker, Streamlit

## 🧠 LLM + AI Engineering Interests
I’m especially interested in building reliable AI systems — not just experiments.

- **Prompt engineering** (structured prompting, guardrails, eval mindset)
- **RAG pipelines** (retrieval + grounding + citation-quality answers)
- **Agentic workflows** (tools, retries, validation, orchestration)
- Traditional ML: **XGBoost, scikit-learn**
- Feature engineering for time-series / noisy industrial signals
- Real-time inference + deployment patterns

## 🏗️ How I work
✅ Strong ownership mindset (0 → 1 systems)  
✅ Production engineering habits (idempotency, failure handling, monitoring)  
✅ Fast execution in high-paced startup environments  
✅ Clear code + scalable architecture  
✅ Comfortable debugging complex distributed workflows  

---

## 📌 Highlights from my work
- Built automation to monitor **hundreds of drilling rigs** and activate data streams without manual intervention  
- Reduced analyst workflows from **24–48 hours → ~1–2 hours** per well using multi-threaded ingestion  
- Designed real-time detectors for drilling state transitions using noisy WITSML/EDR signals  
- Delivered backend services and internal tooling used daily by operations teams
